> Safer rules and smarter toolkit so Claude Code does not accidentally set the world on fire trying to help 🔥

Clauder is a **supercharged toolkit and a safety-first configuration for Claude Code**, designed to provide a robust foundation for AI-assisted development — while remaining *easily configurable and extensible to any project or workflow*.

It **auto-updates** so you always get the latest tools, and never have to think about it again.

> [!WARNING]
> While `clauder` helps setting guardrails, these are **insufficient to autonomously ensure correctness and safety**. `clauder` is solely meant as a safety net and toolset, and *assumes co-supervision by a human in the loop*.

## Requirements

Supported platforms:
- macOS
- linux
- windows (experimental)

> Core features should work on windows as long as running a `bash` terminal. Some MCP servers may not work as is and may need manual setup instead. Please raise any issue encountered and we will try to help.

Supported terminals:
- `bash`
- `zsh`

> Run `bash` to open a bash terminal if running in an unsupported termnial (e.g. shell, powershell)

Required dependencies:

- Python 3.10+
- `pip`
- `git`
- `jq`
- `claude`

Required if using MCP servers (refer to `.mcp.json` for details):
- `npx`
- `uvx`
- `uv`
- `pipx`
- `pnpx`
- `docker`

## Quick Start

> Ensure the requirements above are met

*If you do not have Clauder installed on your machine* (check using `which clauder`): 

```bash
# Clone and install repository
cd ~/ && git clone https://github.com/blueraai/clauder.git && cd clauder && bash ./clauder_install.sh
```

Navigate to your project:
```bash
# Navigate to project root directory (must be a git repository)
cd replace-with-project-root-path # && git init (if not already a repository)
```

In **your project's** `.gitignore`, exclude the following paths for cleaner commits:
```text
.claude 
.claude-backup
.claude-mcp-backup
.mcp.json
```

Activate & start **clauder** in your project:
```bash
# Start clauder session
clauder # (on initial load, choose to ** activate in project ** when prompted)
```
> Check section below for detailed information on how to use `> CLAUDER`

## Installation

> Ensure the requirements above are met
```bash
# Clone repository
cd ~/ && git clone https://github.com/blueraai/clauder.git

# Install (must be run from the `clauder` dir)
cd clauder && bash ./clauder_install.sh
```

## Usage

### Activate Clauder in your project

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Activating Clauder may override any existing `.claude` configuration. Backups will automatically be created to save/restore your existing configurations. These can be found at `./.claude-backup/`, `./.claude-mcp-backup/` for MCP configurations.
>
> Notably, `.claude/settings.json` will be overriden for consistency and security purposes, upon every activation (including auto-updates).
> Custom settings must be defined in `.claude/settings.local.json` to remain persisted throughout clauder activation.

Run in your project directory:

```bash
clauder_activate

# or you may activate it from anywhere else by providing a path to the project
# clauder_activate ./project_path

# or skip this step, start clauder, and choose 'activate' when prompted
```

This will copy the `.claude` configuration to your project.

Clauder's configuration will automatically:

- Create checkpoint commits before each session
- Protect sensitive files and directories (see `.claude/.ignore` and `.claude/.immutable`)
- Log all actions for live monitoring, or auditing purposes (see `.claude/logs`); enabled in `.claude/preferences.md`
- Enforce history and specifications tracking as you interact with Claude Code (see `HISTORY.md`, `SPECIFICATIONS.md`)
- Provides general guidelines/rules to Claude (see `.claude/rules.md`; Never guaranteed, but does help steering it; Do not solely rely on instructions for policing or workflows)
- Provide audio feedback on completion (optional, supports mac, linux experimental; enabled in `.claude/preferences.md`)
- Define custom commands for advanced workflows (e.g. `/consult` to consult a third party model for specific tasks, `/spawn` to create task specific agents, `/recruit` to recruit relevant agents for your project and needs, `/review` for a general review)
   - *Required MCP servers detailed below.*
- Define custom agents to help the main instance achieve specific tasks

> **Domain specific *expansion packs* available** (including agents, commands, hooks and configurations - see below)

### How to start a Claude session

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Opening Claude without interacting is sufficient to index and learn all secrets in the directory. Never keep secrets such as `.env` in the project directory.**
>
> If secrets have been indexed or read by an AI such as Claude, you should consider removing them from the project, invalidating them and renewing them. Production secrets should be stored in a secure vault, unreadable by AI. Keeping secrets out of the working directory prevents auto-indexing, but does not prevent Claude from finding ways to access them through running commands or calling tools. 

> _**Disclaimer**_:
> 
> Clauder will try to prevent leaking secrets, and potentially destructive, or unrecoverable actions, by detecting unsafe operations and requesting a Human in the loop, but none of it is bulletproof.
>
> **Please make sure to supervise your AI's actions as you grant it access to sensitive or critical systems. It cannot be trusted and will inadvertently make unrecoverable mistakes, which may critically impair the company and its production services. Backup your systems, and sandbox as much as possible through restrictive AI-level access control.** You are responsible for your AI's actions, as you are when using any other tool, or when managing a team.
>
> Prefer closer, slower supervision when working on root/core nodes in your project. Equally, allow faster, lower supervision for faster iterations when working on leaf nodes, or when prototyping.

```bash
# Navigate to project root directory (must be a git repository)
cd replace-with-project-root-path # && git init (if not already a repository)
```

In **your project's** `.gitignore`, exclude the following paths for cleaner commits:
```text
.claude 
.claude-backup
.claude-mcp-backup
.mcp.json
```

Start a new **clauder** session:

```bash
clauder
```
> ☕ **clauder includes security features, auto-updates, and configuration backups**. All Claude Code arguments supported (e.g. `--continue` to recall the last session)

In Claude, type:
```
/rules
```

This will define the mandatory guidelines for Claude Code.

> [!TIP]
> - If your project includes a `HISTORY.md` file at root level, **clauder** will enforce keeping a history of requests and actions taken, and use it to reason about the next action to take. Comprehensive history tracking may take time.
> - If your project includes a `SPECIFICATIONS.md` file at root level, **clauder** will enforce keeping an updated list of specifications as it takes actions, and use it to reason about the next action to take. When writing code manually, you may ask **clauder** to read the git diffs and backfill the specifications file.  Comprehensive specifications tracking may take time.
> - Define your secret files and folders in `.claude/.ignore` so **clauder** can guard them from being read/written.
> - Define your read-only files and folders in `.claude/.immutable` so **clauder** can guard them from being overwritten.
> - Exclude safe configuration files and folders in `.claude/.exclude_security_checks` so **clauder** can ommit them from safety checks (e.g. secret detection).
> - Check `.claude/requirements.md` for prerequisites, and recommended [MCP tools](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/mcp). **clauder** will *automatically* take advantage of those tools should you have added them to Claude Code.
> - Check [Claude Code's best practices](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices) for better results.
> - Define your custom settings in `.claude/settings.local.json` instead of `.claude/settings.json`, so they remain persisted when clauder auto-updates.
> - Declare custom rules in `CLAUDE.md` at root level for persisted intructions when clauder auto-updates.

### How to give Claude project-level instructions

Declare custom rules in `CLAUDE.md` at root level for persisted intructions when **clauder** auto-updates. 

> Those will be read by Claude Code on start.

Make sure these instructions do not conflict with **clauder**'s rules (see `.claude/rules.md`).

> Do not modify the **clauder** rules themselves as those will be reset when **clauder** auto-updates.

### How to ask Claude for a general review

You may ask for a general purpose code review using:

```sh
/review
```

or about something specific:

```sh
/review Assess the responsiveness of this application
```

> Create custom commands or sub-agents for project specic-reviews.

### How to ask Claude to consult a different model

While Claude's models are performant for general coding, for particular tasks, such as ones requiring extensive context, or specialized training, requiring help from a different model may lead to better results.

If the [consult7](https://github.com/szeider/consult7) MCP tool is added to Claude Code, with a valid [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) key, **clauder** will allow you to consult any supported model via the following command (default: `openai/gpt-5`, 400k token context; for larger context you may alternatively use `google/gemini-2.5-pro`, 1M token context; larger context windows generally lower performance):

```sh
/consult <user query>
```

e.g.

```sh
/consult Review the security of this application
```

> Note:
> - Files and directories listed in `.claude/.ignore` will not be passed as context.
> - Third party models consulted in the cloud do not have access to Claude Code's tools.

### How to create specialized agents

Claude may create dedicated agents for specific tasks. They are called [Sub-Agents](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/sub-agents) and report to the main `Claude` instance. These agents have their own system prompts, tools subsets (inherit all tools by default), and context window (unaware of other chats). They are helpful in creating and recalling task-specific personas and context.

**clauder** includes a `agent-builder` agent, which helps you define and craft performant agents for your specific needs. Should the [context7](https://github.com/upstash/context7) and [consult7](https://github.com/szeider/consult7) MCP tools be set in Claude Code, it will automatically use them to help enhance the new agent's workflows, best practices, and toolsets. For better results, please be specific and detailed when creating specialized agents.

You may create a new agent simply by asking for it:

```sh
Create a new agent to help review my code, it should.. 
```

or using the `/spawn` command explicitly.

```sh
/spawn Create a new agent to help review my code, it should.. 
```

The resulting agent instructions will be define in `.claude/agents/<agent-name>.md`. You may review, and edit this file to further refine your new sub-agent. You may dismiss a sub-agent at any time, by deleting `.claude/agents/<agent-name>.md`.

**New agents become available/unavailable on start of a new Claude Code session**. Creating or deleting an agent will not apply to current sessions. Start a new **clauder** session to use your newly created agent.

> [!TIP]
> Best practices:
> - **Tailor agents to your specific project and needs**, as you would when recruiting people.
> - **Limit the number of agents, prefer smaller teams with clear separation of ownership/expertise.** Lesser communication and orchestration loss.
> - **Leave all core coding to the main Claude instance, and consult other specialized agents for review or unrelated/leaf tasks.** Agents have their own context and do not know about the general history and reasoning for how and why things were done a certain way, or what other agents have said. Relying on communication greatly degrades the signal and often leads to breakage or unintended side effects. These personas are not better at coding than the main instance, they run the same model and backend orchestration. They are good at prioritizing / directing attention to specific areas - which is particularly useful for review, consultation, and leaf-type activities (as opposed to core parts). **Prefer one chef, with a few very good advisors, than too many chefs or too many advisors.**

#### Looking to recruit new sub agents?

**clauder** includes a command to recommend sub-agents for your project.

You may ask for general project-specific recommendations using:

```sh
/recruit
```

or about something specific:

```sh
/recruit I want to make this web app..
```

### Add and manage MCP servers

> About MCP: https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro

To easily add project specific MCP servers run in your project root:
```bash
clauder_activate
```
> ⚡ 66+ pre-integrated, hot-swappable, MCP servers for instant use. 
> 
> - Configuration automatically backed up locally prior each activation. 
> - MCP servers become active upon running `clauder`.



You may remove them, or update their environment variables at any time in `.mcp.json` at root level.

> **Do not hardcode any secret keys in your project.** Set and reference environment variables instead. Do not leave an empty or malformed `.mcp.json` file as it may interfere with **clauder** when adding servers to your existing configuration.

If you'd like to manually add MCP servers globally or at project level, beyond the list of pre-integrated servers, you may of course as you usually do. Clauder will honor them.

### Expansion packs (beta)

**clauder** also provides **ready-made agents** for various development projects, **optionally installable as *expansion packs***.

#### Installation

```sh
clauder_activate --expansions <expansion_name> <expansion_name>

# e.g.
# clauder_activate --expansions general-software-dev frontend-dev
```
> Expansions remain installed and auto-updated until `.claude` is removed.

#### Usage 

**All agents are automatically called by the main Claude instance when relevant, for advisory purposes.**

If you'd like to query a sub-agent directly (advisory only by design):

```sh
/task <agent_name> "<query>"

# e.g.
#  /task system-architecture-consultant "Analyze the current system architecture..."
#  /task ux-research-specialist "Research user experience patterns for..."
#  /task qa-strategy-specialist "Develop testing strategy for..."
```

Refer to the expansion details for dedicated hooks and commands.

#### Uninstall

```sh
# Important: backup your configuration before resetting it
rm -rf ./.claude && clauder_activate
```
> If you'd like a more surgical approach, you may delete the corresponding `.claude/.expansion_packs` entry and remove the corresponding agents, commands, hooks and settings for that expansion.

#### Creating expansion packs

Clone `.claude-expansion-packs/example` to get started. The folder name is the name of your expansion. Define your custom `agents`, `commands`, `hooks` (set up in `settings.json`), and configurations.

> Disclaimer: Remember to be specific, to prevent conflicts with the base **clauder** setup.

### How to trace & audit Claude

> Disabled by default, requires logging enabled in `.claude/preferences.md`

Every event and automated **clauder** intervention is locally logged in a SQLite database for auditing and live monitoring Claude.

That database is available at `.claude/logs/trace.sqlite`, once the first event has been logged.

Additionally, all `bash` commands ran and MCP tool calls are duplicated as text logs for easy inspection at `.claude/logs/bash-logs.txt` and `.claude/logs/mcp-logs.txt`.

#### Real-time monitoring with Clauder Tracer

> Disabled by default, requires traces enabled in `.claude/preferences.md`

You may use or build any monitoring app you'd like to inspect that SQLite database. For convenience, a lightweight tracer app is also shipped with **clauder**.

You may run the tracer app in a parallel termimal at any time, new events will be live streamed to it:

##### Install

```bash
# install (using conda, in project directory)
conda create -n clauder_trace python=3.11 -y && conda activate clauder_trace && pip install -r ./.claude/tracer/requirements.txt

# install (without conda, in project directory)
pip install -r ./.claude/tracer/requirements.txt
```

##### Run

```bash
# run (using conda, in project directory)
conda activate clauder_trace && clauder_trace

# run (without conda, in project directory)
clauder_trace
```

Access the tracer app at `http://localhost:4441` in your browser.

> [!TIP]
> You may set any of the supported themes: `green`, `blue`, `gray`, `dark`
> 
> Run in browser console: `localStorage.setItem('clauder.tracer.theme', 'dark'); location.reload();`

### Key Configuration Files

#### **`.claude/settings.json`**

Defines hooks and permissions. Will be overriden upon auto-updating to ensure a safe and working setup.

For custom settings use `.claude/settings.local.json` instead, so they remain persisted when clauder auto-updates.

#### **`.claude/.ignore`**

Files and directories to ignore (forbidden read & write).

> [!NOTE]
> As of July 2025, there is no possible way to prevent Claude from automatically & silently learning every change made to the codebase, including secrets. These are only meant as a best effort to prevent retrieving them.

#### **`.claude/.immutable`**

Files and directories that cannot be modified (read-only).

> [!NOTE]
> The immutable file list is strictly enforced and cannot be overridden, even with explicit user permission.

#### **`.claude/.exclude_security_checks`**

Files and directories to skip in security scans.

#### **`.claude/rules.md`**

Behavioral guidelines.

> [!NOTE]
> Rules can never be enforced, they are used to steer the AI in a desired direction.

#### **`.claude/preferences.md`**

User preferences and customization settings.

#### **`.claude/requirements.md`**

Clauder dependencies and recommended MCP servers.

## Security Best Practices

### **Environment Secrets**
- **Never store in project**: Keep secrets outside the working directory
- **Secure vaults**: Use dedicated secret management systems (e.g. doppler, hashicorp vault, unix pass)
- **AI isolation**: Ensure AI cannot access production secrets
- **Regular rotation**: Rotate secrets if accidentally exposed

### **Supervision Requirements**
- **Human oversight**: Always supervise AI operations
- **Backup systems**: Maintain regular backups of critical systems
- **Sandboxing**: Use isolated environments for AI testing
- **Access limits**: Restrict AI access to sensitive systems

## Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

**Clauder crashes my terminal**
```bash
# Clauder will exit for safety purposes when detecting potential secrets, so they do not get indexed by Claude.
# For details about problematic files, run:

clauder_security_check & echo done
```

**New agent not found**
```bash
# New agents become available/unavailable on start of a new Claude Code session.
# Creating or deleting an agent will not apply to current sessions. 
# Start a new session to use your newly created agent.

clauder # (or) clauder --continue
```

**Missing required tools**
```bash
# Install required tools
brew install git jq  # macOS
sudo apt install git jq  # Ubuntu/Debian
```

**Git repository not initialized**
```bash
# Initialize git repository
git init
```

**Permission denied errors**
```bash
# Make hooks executable
chmod +x .claude/hooks/*.py
chmod +x .claude/hooks/*.sh
```

**Audio not working**
```bash
# Check audio preferences
cat .claude/preferences.json
# Ensure "audio_summary.enabled" is true
```

**Safe commands blocked**
```bash
# You may choose to disable unsafe command detection in `.claude/preferences.json` at your own risk
```

**.claude/*: [Errno 2] No such file or directory**
```bash
# You may have an early legacy version of Clauder installed, which is no longer supported. 
# Please pull the latest clauder and rerun 'bash ./clauder_install.sh'.
# Newer versions of Clauder now auto-updates, so you never have to do it again.
```

### **Configuration Issues**

**Aliases not working**
```bash
# Re-run alias setup (Important: Run from the `clauder` directory)
bash ./clauder_install.sh
# Or restart your shell
```

**Security checks failing**
```bash
# Check exclusion patterns (Important: Do not exclude actual secrets)
cat .claude/.exclude_security_checks

# Alternatively, you may choose to disable secret pattern detection in `.claude/preferences.json`
```

**claude: command not found**
```bash
# clauder runs claude in a standard 'bash' shell, irrespective of where it was started (e.g. ZSH).
# You may only have Claude Code installed in a ZSH terminal.

# Please make sure the 'claude' command is also installed in bash terminals (run 'bash' and install Claude Code using these instructions: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/troubleshooting).

# Once installed, confirm installation using:
bash
# Then, in bash terminal
which claude # macOS, Linux
where claude # windows

# If claude's path is displayed, you may now run in any terminal (e.g. ZSH, bash):
clauder
# Else, please refer to troubleshooting link above to fix your Claude Code installation.
```

**Clauder does not auto-update, or 'clauder' fails unexpectedly after updating to the latest version**
```bash
# You may have an early legacy version of Clauder installed, which is no longer supported. 
# Please pull the latest clauder and rerun 'bash ./clauder_install.sh'.
# Newer versions of Clauder now auto-updates, so you never have to do it again.

> Hooks documentation: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/hooks 
>
> **Tips:** Hooks are dedupped and run in parallel. They rely on strict interpretation from the console output for decision making. Make sure never to print anything other than the expected specifications for Claude Code to parse it correctly, any offset will cause Claude Code to omit the decision entirely. Beware of infinite loop, particularly when blocking a 'Stop' event to inject an extra step, as the 'Stop' event will retrigger once that step completes. By default, Claude Code will continue unless set to 'False'. A 'block' decision only blocks a given interaction with a 'reason', at which point Claude Code may decide to take a different action or find a way to bypass it. Use `claude --debug` to enable debug logs when working on hooks, as they are hidden by default. When developing, never test **clauder** changes on a real project as bugs may have irreparable consequences - use a test project instead.
